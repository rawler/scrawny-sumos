Silly little Pyglet/Pymunk-based game about two underfed sumo-wrestlers dueling it out.

The game is intended for two players, or any(one?) with multiple personalities.

Features:
 - Real (simulated) Physics
 - Awesome 3-color line-graphics.
 - 3-dimensional 2d. (Yeah, hardcore stuff)
 - Multiplayer (I.E. Lack of AI).

The game is heavily inspired on an old game, name forgotten. If you recognise it, do tell.
